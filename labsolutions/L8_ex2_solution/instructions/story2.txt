As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand,
with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the near leader violently shook his head
and everything upon it—like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the
coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the
passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.

There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.
A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples
that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome
sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the
coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek
of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
